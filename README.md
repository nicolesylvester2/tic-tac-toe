# Cosmic Tic-Tac-Toe

A cosmic-themed **Tic-Tac-Toe game prototype**.  

This project is a **static prototype**, built to explore UI/UX design rather than full game logic.

**Live demo:**  
Hosted on GitHub Pages [here](https://nicolesylvester2.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)


## What’s Included

- Intro modal
- Player vs Player flow
- Player vs “Cosmos” (bot) flow
- Animated UI elements and hover states
- Themed avatars and custom icons


## What This Is *Not*

- No game logic
- No win/loss detection
- No backend

This is intentionally a **static prototype** focused on design.


## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
   *(or via a local development server)*
